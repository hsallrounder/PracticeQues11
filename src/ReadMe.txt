Q1. Write a program that will check whether a given String is Palindrome or not.

Q2. Given two strings, append them together (known as "concatenation") and return the result.
However, if the concatenation creates a double-char, then omit one of the chars.
If the inputs are “Mark” and “Kate” then the output should be “markate”. (The output should be in lowercase)

Q3. Given a string, return a new string made of n copies of the first 2 chars of the original string
where n is the length of the string. The string may be any length.
If there are fewer than 2 chars, use whatever is there.
If the input is “Apple” then the output should be “ApApApApAp”

Q4. Given two strings, a and b, create a bigger string made of the first char of a,
the first char of b, the second char of a, the second char of b, and so on.
Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.
If the inputs are "Hello" and "World", then the output is "HWeolrllod".

Q5. Given a string and an int n, return a string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string.
You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive.
For example, if the inputs are “Niraj” and 3, then the output should be “rajrajraj.
